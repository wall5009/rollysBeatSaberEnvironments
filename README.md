# rollylindenshnizzer's awesome and epic beat saber environments!!!
A full repo of Environment Enhancements I do for my Beat Saber maps. These may include blender files.
I'm going to assume you know how to use these files so if you don't, read [this](https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki/EnvironmentJSONS) before you do something stupid.
Also, these can be REALLY difficult to understand if you don't know what you're doing. So I reccomend reading [this](https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki/Environment) before you try something like making your own.

# WARNING WARNING VERY IMPORTANTE!!!
i swear if I catch any of you using my environments without my permission I will personally track you down and kill you. Cheers!
